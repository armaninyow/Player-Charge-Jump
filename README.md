## Functionality
<details>
  <summary></summary>
   
Player Charge Jump gives the player the same charged jump ability that horses have. Holding **Shift+Space** begins a charge sequence — a familiar horse-style jump bar appears on the HUD showing your current charge level. Release at the right moment to launch yourself over fences and obstacles that a normal jump can't clear.

- **Tap Space** (without Shift) → standard vanilla jump, unchanged
- **Hold Shift+Space** past the delay → the jump bar appears and starts filling
- **Release in the orange zone** (the sweet spot) → charge jump, clearing fence-height obstacles
- **Overcharge or miss** the sweet spot → the bar shrinks back and you land a standard vanilla jump instead
</details>

## Benefits

- Lets players clear fences and 1.5-block obstacles without building stairs, gates, or relying on horses
- Uses vanilla horse HUD textures — no visual mods or resource packs needed
- No extra keybinds to configure — just hold Shift+Space
- Fully configurable delay and charge speed via Cloth Config and Mod Menu
